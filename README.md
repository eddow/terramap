# TerraMap

A research that was begun 20 years ago and finally gets implemented after a big inactivity.
The purpose is to have a huge structure (planet) always detailed where we look and randomly generated, keeping its consistance (not changing when the user come back to a place) but not having the 3D engine managing millions of vertex.

## First phase development

The main ideas are now being implemented so it is still unusable but saved on GH
